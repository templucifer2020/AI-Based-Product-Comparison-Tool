ProductInsight AI - Local Setup Instructions
============================================

QUICK SETUP (5 minutes):

1. EXTRACT FILES
   - Extract all files from the zip to your desired folder
   - Open terminal/command prompt in that folder

2. INSTALL NODE.JS (if not installed)
   - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
   - Choose the LTS version (recommended)
   - Restart your computer after installation

3. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
   - In the project folder, run:
     npm install
   - This will download all required packages

4. GET API KEY
   - Visit: https://ai.google.dev/
   - Sign in with Google account
   - Create a new API key (free)
   - Copy the API key

5. CONFIGURE API KEY
   - Copy the file ".env.example" and rename it to ".env"
   - Open ".env" file in a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.)
   - Find the line: GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   - Replace "your_gemini_api_key_here" with your actual API key
   - Make sure there are no spaces around the = sign
   - Save the file

   Example:
   GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyC-YOUR-ACTUAL-API-KEY-HERE

6. START THE APP
   - In terminal, run: npm run dev
   - Wait for "serving on port 5000" message
   - Open browser to: http://localhost:5000

THAT'S IT! Your app is now running locally.

TESTING:
- Try uploading a clear photo of a product label
- The AI will analyze ingredients and provide safety information
- You can compare multiple products side-by-side

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If you get errors, make sure Node.js is properly installed
- Check that your API key is correctly set in the .env file
- Ensure your internet connection is working
